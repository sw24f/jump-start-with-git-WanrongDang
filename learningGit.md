# Learning Git

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's changes. It's commonly used for source code management in software development.

## Common Git Commands
Here are some basic Git commands that are essential to understand:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clones an existing repository from a remote source to our local machine.
- `git status`: Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.
- `git add <file>`: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes our local commits to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into our local branch.
- `git branch`: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
- `git checkout`: Switches branches or restores working tree files.
- `git merge`: Combines changes from different branches.

## Personal Notes
This section will be used to add my personal learning experiences as I continue to learn Git and GitHub.
- Today,I learned how to initialize a Git repository and clone a repo to my local machine.
- I practiced adding files to the staging area and commiting changes with informative messages.
- I edit this file on github.com directly.
### New Feature Section
- Practiced using 'git diff' to compare changes between commits.
- Lerning how to stage files and commit changes.
